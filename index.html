            <p>
                How many times in your life have you found yourself asking yourself the following question: how can I become the best I can be? If you're like most of us, chances are that, as much as you'd like to ask, there just is never enough time or concentration available to do so. It's MIT. Classes are challenging, research and extracurriculars are everywhere, and in this vortex time is always escaping. That's where Alpha Delta Phi comes in. <br/>

Boasting a diverse population of multiple cultures and personalities, ADPhiâ€™s mission is to have every single member become the best that they can be. Each brother, by making a promise to brotherhood, is committed to supporting his brethren in striving towards academic, ethical, and personal goals, all while maintaining a vibrant and eclectic social atmosphere that accommodates a multitude of interests. <br/>
